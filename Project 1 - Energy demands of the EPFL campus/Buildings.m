% Description: function to CALL to calculate, for A GIVEN building:
% (1) the internal heat gains 
% (2) the building envelope properties (Newton-Raphson)
% (3) the hourly heating demand
% (4) the typical periods (clustering)

% Initial parameters

% Call of the weather data

% Call of the buildings data

% Index and variable definition
index = find(ismember(name, building_name));

Build.Q = data{1,4}(index);         % Building annual heat load [kWh]
Build.El = data{1,5}(index);        % Building annual electricity consumption [kWh]

%% TASK 1 - Calculation of the internal heat gains (appliances & humans)

% 1.1 - Electronic appliances and lights for each buildings 
Q_el = Build.El*0.8*3654 %[kJ]


% 1.2 - Presence of people (all the buildings are the same)
heat_gain = [5, 35, 23.3, 0]
share         = [0.3, 0.05, 0.35, 0.3]
weight_avg = dot(heat_gain, share)


%% TASK 2 - Calculation of the building thermal properties (kth and ksun)

% First equation - switching ON the heating system

% Second equation - yearly heating demand

% Implementation of the Newton-Raphson method
    
    % Method initialisation
    
    % Resolution

%% TASK 3 - Estimation of the hourly profile    

% Hourly demand (thermal load)

%% TASK 4 - Clustering of the heating demand
% based on the hourly heating demand (typical periods)
