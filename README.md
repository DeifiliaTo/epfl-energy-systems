## Code standards


- make sure to **comment** your code

  - equation numbers & section references from the handout
  - include units to the right of a variable being assigned

  for example, like this
  ```matlab
  % Index and variable definition
  index = find(ismember(name, building_name));
  Build.ground = data{1,3}(index);    % Building heated surface [m2]
  Build.Q = data{1,4}(index);         % Building annual heat load [kWh]
  ```
- write **descriptive commit messages**
- name variables consistently
